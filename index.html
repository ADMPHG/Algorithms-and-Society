      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>President Obama successfully leveraged social media to achieve victory during the 2008 US election by reaching voters in a way that had never been attempted before. Since then,  politicians - and the private organisations they employ - have exploited the internet and its underlying technologies to increasing degrees as part of their campaigns to influence the masses. This page aims to demonstrate whether this is ultimately a good development for society.
      </p>

      <h2>Negative Impact</h2>
      <p>Big tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, develop and implement algorithms that analyse your interactions with content on their sites. This allows them to build a profile of your opinions so they can show you more content that they think you will like. The inherent downside to this is that it gives these companies a huge amount of power over the political sphere. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/22/facebook-edgerank/"><cite>Kincaid(2010)</cite></a> states;
        <blockquote>
        "...the algorithmic editorial voice of Facebook, determines what is shown on usersâ€™ Top News by drawing on different factors (i.e., affinity and time decay)."
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>As Facebook builds up its profile of a user, it will inevitably show that user content from a narrower range of sources, containing a specific set of opinions. This creates a situation where the viewpoint of a user is reinforced without ever being challenged, a concept referred to as an 'echo chamber'.</p>

      <h2>Positive Impact</h2>
      <p>As internet access is widely available, most people have the opportunity to post their political thought and ideas on the internet and have them reach a wide audience. Prior to the internet, politics had a far greater barrier to entry, as it would require a significant amount of capital to engage with the same number of people via physical media. Of course, the size of the audience reached depends on whether the algorithms behind Facebook etc. decide if the content is worthy, but the opportunity is there nonetheless.
        <br>
        <br>
        Politics is a very divisive topic. As such, it guarantees a large amount of engagement online. This means that algorithms favour it, and will regularly promote it ahead of other content in news feeds/search results. With politics making up a big chunk of the content consumed by users, more people are engaged in it than ever before.</p>
