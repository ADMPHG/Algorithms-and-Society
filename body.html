    <h1>THE IMPACT OF THE GROWTH OF COMPUTING IN THE ECONOMIC DOMAIN</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="container">
    <p><h4>In recent years, there have been several major advances in computing that have led to innovations in the Economic domain. 
            The growth of computing for economics led to better calculations with a lot more data free to use safely, new ways to analyse recent developing markets, etc.
            In some ways the recent augmented use of computing has led to Economic growth not in terms of GDP but more in terms of living standards for the general population. 
            According to Robert Solow, most of the increases in human living standards have come from improved productivity and not simply working more hours. 
            This improvement in productivity in recent years can trace itself back to major advances in computing who has enabled people to be far more productive and efficient while they work. 
            The heavy use of computing however has not been foolproof however with people being excluded from this shift to advanced technology.</h4>

    <h2>Improvements in the Economic Domain</h2>
    <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>

    <p><h4>One topic that springs to mind when we talk about technology in the economic domain is the use of cryptocurrencies. 
        A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is meant to be a medium of exchange. 
        Key characteristics of cryptocurrencies include the existence of limits on the of number units that can exist, they operate independently to a bank and makes it very easy to verify the transfer of funds.   
        Most modern day transactions are quite fluid and problem free, however problems can still occur when we make an online transaction such as a technical issue with our bank or a hacker making his way into your accounts.</h4>

    <br>    
        
    <p><h4>Cryptocurrency was created to try and get around all these rare but existential problems one might face when making a digital transaction in the modern world. 
        If two people were to make a transaction using a cryptocurrency there would be  short processing period where the app used would make sure it is the correct individual authoring the payment (face ID with Apple pay). Once that processing period is completed the transaction is completed within minutes. 
        As of 2018, there was more than 1600 cryptocurrencies available and almost every single day a new cryptocurrency is created. 
        If Cryptocurrencies are used quite extensively it is mainly due to the fact that they have little to no transaction fees, users get 24/7 access to money, they are free for anyone to use and they make international payments much faster and easier.</h4>

    <h3>The Growth of the Computing Industry</h3>
    <div>
      <img src="images/Apple_logo.png" width="80" height="100">

    <p><h4>Let us take the example of Apple, Apple Inc. was founded on the 1st of 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. 
      This company was created to try and innovate the computer industry by creating a computer that people could have in their homes and offices. 
      We must keep in mind that at the time where Apple was founded, computers were large machines that would take up the majority of any room in which they were in. </h4>
      <div>
        <img src="images/Apple 2.png" widht="100" height="100">
      </div>
      
    </p>
    <p><h4>Apple quickly became very much successful in a few years with its commercialisation of the Apple II, the very first miniaturised computer Apple created which contained a monitor, keyboard and CPU. 
      With this new innovation sales for Apple jumped from $7.8 million in 1978 to $117 million in 1980.  
      From its expansion to modern times, Apple has never stop pushing the boundaries of computing as they make increasingly sophisticated technological products. 
      A very good example of this is when in 2007 Apple commercialised the iPhone, a new product that is small enough for people to carry around, offering many essential services such as access to internet, GPS, photos, etc. 
      Before the iPhone, most smartphones did not offer as many services as the iPhone and were not very user friendly. 
      The commercialisation of the iPhone led to Apple taking the lead in the technological industry and therefore surpassing Nokia, Blackberry and Microsoft.
      Apple has continued to innovate the iPhone and have been continuing to improve this product throughout the years.  </h4>

    <h2>The Decline in the Economic Domain</h2>
    <h3>Jobs slowly dying</h3>

    <h4>As we saw in the first part, advances in computing have brought many economic benefits to the world however there have been some downsides to all these innovations. 
      For example, a few years ago, the mechanisation of agriculture led to many farmers losing their jobs. 
      Things have only gotten harder for farmers because advances in computing have enabled the creation of robotic agricultural machinery. 
      Even though this makes it easier for farmers to produce more crops, most farmers often lack the necessary funds to buy these up to date pieces of equipment which are used by larger agricultural firms. 
      This means that it is often large agricultural firms that produce the most crops and now they are in need of even less workforce. 
      Independent farmers therefore struggle to keep up with the production of these companies and the employees of these companies find themselves out of work because they are no longer needed.    
      This is the case in many other sectors such as the industrial production of cars. Assembly lines are now solely constituted of several robotic machines that are very productive and reliable. 
      There was once a time where the assembly line for cars would be made up mostly of machines but also of five or six workers who were responsible for attaching specific parts to make the final product. 
      This however is no longer the case for many car companies who now have such sophisticated machines that the specific parts are no longer put in place by workers but machines.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <h4>As we can see the economic domain of our Society is becoming increasingly dependent on computing which in some ways can really benefit our Society, 
        however we must keep in mind that this shift to technology can have a negative impact on our Society and must try as best we can to limit this impact and help the people affected.
